import "fmt"

// Usage in Go:
// complex64: Can store complex numbers with less precision (because of the 32-bit parts).
// complex128: Can store complex numbers with more precision (because of the 64-bit parts).// Creating a Complex Number:
// In Go, you can use the complex() function to create a complex number:
func main() {

	var a = complex(1, 2) // 1 is the real part, 2 is the imaginary part
	fmt.Println(a)
}

// Signal Processing: Used in digital signal processing (DSP) for analyzing signals in the frequency domain.
// Electrical Engineering: Representing AC circuits, impedance, and phasors involves complex numbers, especially in power system analysis.
// Physics and Engineering: In fields like quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, or electromagnetism, complex numbers are used to represent waves, oscillations, and other phenomena.
// 3D Graphics: Sometimes complex numbers are used to handle certain geometric transformations.
// Mathematics: Complex numbers are used in algorithms dealing with polynomial equations, fractals (like the Mandelbrot set), and Fourier transforms.
