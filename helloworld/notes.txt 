how to create the executable file in go (linux)

go build hello.go (filename)

2. Rebuild the Executable

If your Go code is correct and you’re still seeing the configuration error, rebuild the executable to ensure you’re running
 the latest version of your code:

 go build -o helloworld helloworld.go

3. Run the Executable
=======================
./filename  (without .go)


Golang doesn't rely on a virtual machine for code compilation and 
is directly compiled from the binary file. 
That's why it is much faster than Java when it comes to application development.
 Golang's automatic garbage collection also contributes to its speed and makes it much faster than Java.


Run time
In one test, a Go program ran a regex in 3.55 seconds,
 while the same test in Java took 5.58 seconds.
